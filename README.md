# dMail - Temporary Email Provider and Random Password Generator
>Forget about spam, advertising mailings, hacking and attacking robots. Keep your real mailbox clean and secure. Temp Mail provides temporary, secure, anonymous, free, disposable email address.

"dMail" is a tool I created that provides you with a disposable Email address you can use to anywhere. For convenience sake, I also included a built in password generator to streamline the process.

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository
2. In the project folder run: 
```shell script
	yarn install
```
3. Use command `yarn start` to start the server
4. Use command `yarn build` to generate production build

## P.S.

I'm still working on it, but feel free to fork or clone the repo and make it your own
